StrutsTestCase for JUnit - release 2.1.4
----------------------------------------

This is a point release to add support for Struts 1.3. Tests written
for Struts 1.2 apps that have since been deployed to 1.3 may be tested
under 1.3 with this release. 

This release does NOT support configurations that use the
ComposableRequestProcessor new to Struts 1.3 -- only the 1.2
RequestProcessor/TilesRequestProcessor or their subclasses. Full-fledged
support for 1.3-style applications will be offered in a future release.

The StrutsTestCase library is available as three distinct
releases supporting the 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 versions of the 
Servlet specification, and the 1.2 (and 1.3) versions of the Struts
Framework. PLEASE NOTE that StrutsTestCase no longer supports
the Struts 1.0 release.
